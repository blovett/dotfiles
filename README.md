# ben's dotfiles

these are my dotfiles.  the organization is heavily influenced by [@holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

## install

Run this command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/blovett/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink any appropriate files in the '~/.dotfiles' directory into your home directory.

For more examples of how things work, see [@holman's dotfiles README](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/README.markdown).
